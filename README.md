Incorporating data from MTA's
[developer](http://web.mta.info/developers/download.html) website and
the Census.

This code obtains and formats public data, and calculates the "coverage
area" for each subway station in the MTA transit system (excluding Staten
Island). These areas are subsequently matched to Census data to get
a picture of the demographic distribution of New York City relative to its
transit system.
